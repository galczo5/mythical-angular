BTW - async pipes are easy to use.
Sounds very cool, right?
Unfortunately, it&amp;rsquo;s not true. It would be so good to use async pipes everywhere and don&amp;rsquo;t worry about any observable related performance problems.
Before I&amp;rsquo;ll start to explain where the problem with async pipe is, let&amp;rsquo;s check how it&amp;rsquo;s implemented.</description></item><item><title>Intro - What is 'Mythical Angular'</title><link>https://galczo5.github.io/mythical-angular/posts/intro/</link><pubDate>Thu, 27 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://galczo5.github.io/mythical-angular/posts/intro/</guid><description>1 2 3 4 5 6 function main() { return &amp;#39;Hello world!&amp;#39;; } const result = main(); console.info(result); Hi all!
My Name is Kamil Gałek, and I&amp;rsquo;m frontend developer. My daily work is based mostly on the Angular framework. I had that opportunity to learn a lot from my more experienced colleagues, and I think it&amp;rsquo;s time to share what I know.
I&amp;rsquo;m a technical recruiter too. I decided to create this page because I found that there are some myths about Angular and its internals.</description></item></channel></rss>
